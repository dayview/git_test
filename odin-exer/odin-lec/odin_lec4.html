<!-- Lists -->

<!-- Whether it be IMDB's top 250 movies or the FBI's most wanted, lists
     are everywhere on the web and you are going to need one eventually in
     your webpages.
-->

<!-- Unordered Lists -->

<!-- If you want to have a list of items where the order doesn't matter,
     like a shopping list of items that can be bough in any order, then
     you can use an unordered list.

     Unordered lists are created using the <ul> element, and each item within
     the list created using the list item element <li>.

     Each list item in an unordered list begins with a bullet point:
     <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
     </ul>

     !! The expected output should show something like this:
        • Item 1
        • Item 2
        • Item 3
-->

<!-- Ordered Lists -->

<!-- If you instead want to create a list of items where the order does matter,
     like step-by-step instructions for a recipe, or your top 10 favorite TV shows, then you can use an ordered list.
     
     Ordered lists are created using the <ul> element. Each individual item in them is again created using the list item element <li>. However, each list item in an ordered list begins with a number instead:
     <ol>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
     </ol>

     !! The expected output should show something like this:
        1. Item 1
        2. Item 2
        3. Item 3
-->
