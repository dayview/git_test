<!-- Intro to CSS -->

<!-- At the most basic level, CSS is made up of various rules. Each rule is
     made up of a selector and a semicolon-separated list of declarations, wtih each of those declarations being made up of a property-value pair.
     
     div.bold-text { <- selector
       property -> font-weight: 700; <- value
     }

     div.bold-text - selector
     font-weight   - property
     700           - value
-->

<!-- Semantic HTML
     
     !! A <div> is one of the basic HTML elements, as it is an empty container.
        In general, it is best to use other tags such as <h1> or <p> for content in your projects, but as we learn more about CSS you'll find that there are many cases where the thing you need is just a container for other elements.

        Many of the module's exercises use plain <div>s for simplicity.

        Later lessons will go into much more depth about when it is appropriate to use the various HTML elements!
-->

<!-- Selectors -->

<!-- Selectors refer to the HTML elements to which CSS rules apply; they're
     what is actually being "selected" for each rule. They're the most common by far and the ones you should get comfortable first.
-->

<!-- Universal Selector -->

<!-- The universal selector will select elements of every type (as in the whole
     document), hence the name "universal", and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk.

     In the example below, every element would have the "color: purple;" style applied to it.

     * {
        color: purple;
     }
-->

<!-- Type Selectors -->

<!-- A type selector (or element selector) will select all elements of the
     given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element:
     
     in index.html:

     <div>Hello, World!</div>
     <div>Hello again!</div>
     <p>Hi...</p>
     <div>Okay, bye.</div>

     in styles.css:
     div {
        color: white;
     }

     !! Here, all three <div> elements would be selected, while the <p> element wouldn't be.
-->

<!-- Class Selectors -->

<!-- Class selectors will select all
     elements within the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element.
     
     Here's how you add a class to an HTML tag and select it in CSS:
     
     in index.html:
     <div class="alert-text">Please agree to our terms of service.</div>

     in styles.css:
     .alert-text {
        color: red;
     }

     !! Note the syntax for class selectors: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute.

     Classes aren't required to be specific to a particular element, so you can use the same class on as many elements as you want.

     -- Leading Digits and Classes --
     !! Class selectors won't work if the class name begins with a number.

     For example, if you give the element the class name "4lert-text", using ."4lert-text" as a selector won't match it.
     
     Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as class="alert-text severe-alert".

     Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.
-->

<!-- ID Selectors -->

<!-- ID selectors are similar to class
     selectors. They select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you place on an HTML element.
     
     The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have on ID.
     
     It cannot be repeated on a single page and should not contain any whitespace:
     
     in index.html:
     <div id="title">My Awesome 90's page</div>
     
     in styles.css:
     #title {
        background-color: red;
     }

     For IDs, instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute.

     A common pitfall is people overusing the ID attribute when they don't necessarily need to, and when classes will suffice.

     While there are cases where using an ID makes sense or is needed, such as taking advantage of specificity or having links redirect to a section on the current page, you should use IDs sparingly (if at all).

     -- Leading Digits and IDs --
     !! Just like class selectors, ID selectors can't start with a number.

     For example, if you give an element the ID "7itle", the selector "#7itle" won't work as it's not a valid CSS selector.
-->

<!-- Grouping Selector -->

<!-- What if we have two groups of
     elements that share some of their style declarations?
     
     in styles.css:
     .read {
        color: white;
        background-color: black;
        /* several unique declarations */
     }
     
     .unread {
        color: white;
        background-color: black;
        /* several unique declarations */
     }
     
     Both our ".read" and ".unread" selectors share the "color: white;" and "background-color: black;" declarations, but otherwise have several of their own unique declarations.

     To cut down on the repetition, we can group these two selectors together as a comma-separated list:

     .read,
     .unread {
          color: white;
          background-color: black;
      }

      .read {
          /* several unique declarations */
      }

      .unread {
          /* several unique declarations */
      }

      Both of the examples above (with and without grouping) will have the same result, but the second example reduces the repetition of declarations and makes it easier to edit either the "color" or "background-color" for both classes at once.
-->

<!-- Chaining Selectors -->

<!-- Another way to use selectors is to
     chain them as a list without any separation.
     
     Let's say we had the following HTML:
     <div>
          <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
          <p class="subsection preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
     </div>
     
     We have two elements with the "subsection" class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if we only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has "header" as a second class?

     Well, we could chain both the class selectors together in our CSS like so:
     .subsection.header {
          color: red;
     }

     What ".subsection.header" does is it selects any element that has both the "subsection" and "header" classes.

     Notice how there isn't any space between the ".subsection" and ".header" class selectors.

     This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one type selector.

     This can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:

     <div>
          <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
          <p class="subsection" id="preview">This is where a preview for a post might go.</p>
     </div>

     You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:

     .subsection.header {
          color: red;
      }

     .subsection#preview {
          color: blue;
      }

      !! In general, you can't chain more than one type selector since an element can't be two different types at once.

      For example, chaining two type selectors like "div" and "p" would give us the selector "divp", which wouldn't work since the selector would try to find a literal <divp> element, which doesn't exist.  
-->

<!-- Descendant Combinator -->

<!-- Combinators allow us to combine
     multiple selectors differently than either grouping or chaining them, as they show a relationship between the selectors.
     
     There are four types of combinators in total, but for right now we're going to only show you the descendant combinator, which is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors.
     
     A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancesotr (parent, grandparent, etc.) that matches the previous selector.
     
     So, something like ".ancestor .chilf" would select an element with the class "child" if it has an ancestor with the class "ancestor".
     
     Another way to think of it is that "child" will only be selected if it is nested inside "ancestor", regardless of how deep that nesting is.
     
     Take a quick look at the example below and see if you can tell which elements would be selected based on the CSS rule provided:
     
     in index.html:
     <div class="ancestor">
          <div class="contents">
               <div class="contents"></div>
          </div>
     </div>
     
     <div class="contents"></div>
     
     in styles.css:
     .ancestor .contents {
          /* some declarations */
      }
          
      In the above example, the first two elements with the "contents" class (on lines 223 and 224) would be selected, but the last element (on line 228) wouldn't be.

      There's really no limit to how many combinators you can add to a rule, so ".one .two .three .four" would be totally valid. This would just select an element that has a class of "four" if it has an ancestor with a class of "three", and if that ancestor has its own ancestor with a class of "two", and so on.

      You generally want to avoid trying to select elements that need this level of nesting, though, as it can get pretty confusing and long, and it can cause issues when it comes to specificity.
-->

<!-- Properties to get started with! -->

<!-- There are some CSS properties that you're going to be used all the time,
     or at the very least more often than not.
     
     !! Note that all properties will have a default initial value, which will be used if neither you nor the browser has set a different value (MDN docs for each CSS property will detail these.)
-->

<!-- Color and background-color -->

<!-- The "color" property sets an element's text color, while 
     "background-color" sets, well, the background color of an element.
     
     Both of these properties can accept one of several kinds of values. A common one is a keyword, such as an actual color name like "red" or the "transparent" keyword.
     
     They also accept HEX, RGB, and HSL values, which you may be familiar with if you've ever used a photo editing program or a site where you could customize your profile colors.
     
     p {
          /* hex example */
          color: #1100ff;
     }

     p {
          /* rgb example */
          color: rgb(100, 0, 127);
     }

     p {
          /* hsl example */
          color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);
     }

     !! If you want to take a quick look at CSS Legal Color Values (https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) to see how you can adjust the opacity of these color by adding an "alpha" value.
-->

<!-- Typography Basic and text-align -->

<!-- "font-family" can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values
     that determine what font an element uses.
     
     Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a "font family name" like "Times New Roman" (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a "generic family name" like "serif" (generic family names never use quotes).
     
     If a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it's best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. "font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;"

     "font-size" will, as the property name suggests, set the size of the font. When giving a value to this property, the value should not contain any whitespace, e.g. "font-size: 22px" has no space between "22" and "px".

     "font-weight" affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight. This value can be a keyword, e.g. "font-weight: bold", or a number between 1 and 1000, e.g. "font-weight: 700" (the equivalent of bold). Usually, the numeric values will be in increments of 100 up to 900, though this will depend on the font.

     "text-align" will align text horizontally within an element, and you can use the common keywords you may have come across in word processors as the value for this property, e.g. "text-align: center".
-->

<!-- Image height and width -->

<!-- Images aren't the only elements that
     we can adjust the height and width
     on, but we want to focus on them specifically in this case.
     
     By default, an <img> element's "height" and "width" values will be the same as the actual image file's height and width. If you wanted to adjust the size of the image without causing it to lose its proportions, you would use a value of "auto" for the "height" property and adjust the "width" value:
     
     img {
          height: auto;
          width: 500px;
      }

      !! For example, if an image's original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.

      These properties work in conjunction with the height and width attributes in the HTML.

      It's best to include both of these properties and the HTML attributes for image elements, even if you don't plan on adjusting the values from the image file's original ones.

      When these values aren't included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, it won't take up any space on the page at first but will suddently cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in.

      Explicity stating a "height" and "width" prevents this from happening, as space will be "reserved" on the page and appear blank until the image loads.
-->

<!-- Adding CSS to HTML -->

<!-- Now that we've learned some basic
     syntax, you might be wondering how to add all this CSS to our HTML. There are three methods to do so.
     
     1. External CSS
     External CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an  HTML's opening and closing <head> tags with a void <link> element.
          
     in index.html:
     <head>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
     </head>

     First, we add a void <link> element inside of the opening and closing <head> tags of the HTML file.

     The <href> attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you'll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file.

     In our example above, we are assuming both files are located in the same directory.

     The <hrel> attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.

     in styles.css:
     div {
          color: white;
          background-color: black;
     }

     p {
          color: red;
     }

     Then, inside of the newly created "styles.css" file, we have the selector (the "div" and "p"), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a "declaration block".

     Finally, we place any declarations inside of the declaration block. "color: white;" is one declaration, with "color" being the property and 
     "white" being the value, and "background-color: black;" is another declaration.

     A note on file names: "styles.css" is just what we went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is ".css", though "style" or "styles" is most commonly used.

     A couple of the pros to this method are:
          1. It keeps our HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.

          2. We only need to edit the CSS in one place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.
     
     2. Internal CSS (or embedded CSS)
     involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file.
     
     With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <style> tags, which are then placed inside of the opening and closing <head> tags of your HTML file.
          
     Since the styles are being placed directly inside of the <head> tags, we no longer need a <link> element that the external method requires.
          
     Besides these differences, the syntax is exactly the same as the external method (selector, curly braces, declarations):
     
     <head>
          <style>
               div {
                    color: white;
                    background-color: black;
               }

               p {
                    color: red;
               }
          </style>
     </head>
     <body>
          ...
     </body>

     This method can be useful for adding unique styles to a single page of a website, but it doesn't keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.
     
     3. Inline CSS 
     Inline CSS makes it possible to
     add styles directly to HTML elements, though this method isn't as recommended:
     
     <body>
          <div style="color: white; background-color: black;">...</div>
     </body>

     The first thing to note is that we don't actually use any selectors here, since the styles are being added directly to the opening <div> tag itself.

     Next, we have the "style=" attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks being the declarations.

     If you need to add a unique style for a single element, this method can work just fine.

     Generally, though, this isn't exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:
     
     1. It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a lot of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML file to become unnecessarily bloated.

     2. If you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy and paste the same style to each individual element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.

     3. Any inline CSS will override the two methods, which can cause unexpected results.
     (While the module states that it won't dive into this lesson, this can actually be taken advantage of).

<!-- Knowledge Check 
     1. What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
     .container (for class selectors), #div (for ID selectors)

     2. How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
     To apply a single rule to two different selectors, use a comma-separated list:

     h1, h2, .special {
          /* fancy shmancy code */
     }

     !! This applies the same styles to all three selectors: h1, h2, and elements with class "special".

     In context:
     .button-one, .button-two, .button-three {
          background-color: #007bff;
          padding: 10px 20px;
          border-radius: 5px;
     }

     !! All three buttons get identical styling, even though they have different class names.

     !!! Comma between each selector, no comma after the final selector, can mix element selectors (h1), class selectors (.button), ID selectors (#header), etc.

     3. Given an element that has an id of "title" and a class of "primary", how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
     I would use both attributes for a single rule by using both class and ID selectors by: 
     .primary#title {
          /* fancy shmancy code */
     }

     4. What does the descendant combinator do?
     What the descendant combinator does is that, for each parent-child or ancestor-descendant relationship determined in the HTML file by using this syntax:

     .ancestor .descendant or ancestor descendant {
          /* fancy shmancy code */
     }

     5. What are the names of the three ways to add CSS to HTML?
     External, Internal, and Inline

     6. What are the main differences between the three ways of adding CSS to HTML?
     External is creating another file generally called "styles.css", then declaring the link href in the HTML file. (e.g. <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css")

     Internal is declaring the <style> attribute inside <head> with the given syntax:
          <head>
               <style>
                    div {
                         /* fancy shmancy code */
                    }
               </style>
          </head>
          <body>
               /* content here */
          </body>
          
     Inline is explicitly declaring the attributes inside the HTML element tags (e.g. <div style="background: white; /* so on and so forth">Text here</div>)
