<!-- HTML Boilerplate -->

<!-- All HTML documents have the same basic structure or boilerplate
     that needs to be in place before anything useful can be done.
-->

<!-- Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration. The doctype's purpose is to tell
     the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document.
     The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is
     <!DOCTYPE html>
-->

<!-- After declaring the doctype, we need to provide an <html> element.
     Known as the root element of the document, meaning that every other
     element in the document will be a descendant of it.-->
 
    <!-- This becomes more important later on when we manipulate HTml with
         JavaScript. For now, just know that the <html> element should be included
         on every HTML document.-->

<!-- Let's add the <html> element by typing out its opening and closing tags, like so:
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     </html>
-->

<!-- Notice the word "lang" here? It represents an HTML attribute which is associated with
     the given HTML tag (i.e <html> in this case)
     
     These attributes provide additional information about HTML elements
-->

<!-- What is the lang attribute?
     "lang" specifies the language of the text content in the element
     This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage.
     It allows assistive technologies, for example screen readers, to adapt according
     to the language and invoke correct pronounciation.
-->

<!-- Head element
     The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages,
     and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser.
     Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.
-->

<!-- Back in our "index.html" file, let's add a <head> element with a <meta> element and a
     title within it. The <head> element goes within the <html> element and should always
     be the first element under the opening <html> tag -->

<!-- Meta element 
     We should always have the <meta> tag with the charset encoding of the webpage in the <head>
     element: <meta charset="UTF-8">

     Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will
     display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.
-->

<!-- Title element 
     Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the <title> element
     
     <title>My First Webpage</title>

     The <title> element, the webpage's title would default to its file name.
     In our case that would be "index.html", which isn't very meaningful for users;
     this would make it very difficult to find our webpage if the user has many
     browser tabs open.

     There are many more elements that can go within the head of an HTML document.
     However, for now it's only crucial to know about the two elements we have covered here.
-->

<!-- Body element 
     The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the <body> element
     This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go -- the text,
     images, lists, links, and so on.

     To complete the boilerplate, add a <body> element to the "index.html" file.
     The <body> element also goes within the <html> element and is always below the
     <head> element, like so:

     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
          <head>
               <meta charset="UTF-8">
               <title>My First Webpage</title>
          </head>

          <body>
          </body>
     </html>
-->

<!-- Knowledge Check 
     1. What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?
          The purpose of the doctype declaration communicates to the web browser that the file should be rendered in HTML5.
          + tells the browser to use modern HTML5 standards for rendering the page, prevents the browser from using
          "quirks mode" (legacy rendering)

     2. What is the HTML element?
          The HTML element declares that the language given from the file is initialized to a set language (e.g. en, ru, etc.)
          + specifies the document's language for accessibility and search engines

     3. What is the purpose of the head element?
          The purpose of the head element is declaring the title of the .html file, other dependencies (like meta charset, meta view, etc)
          + contains metadata that doesn't display on the page but is crucial and links to CSS/scripts

     4. What is the purpose of the body element?
          The purpose of the body element is declaring all content that will be displayed to users on the webpage, such as
          text, images, links, and other visible elements
