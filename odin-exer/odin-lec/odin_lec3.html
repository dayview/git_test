<!-- Working with Text -->

<!-- Most content on the web is text-based, so you will find yourself needing to work with HTML
     text elements quite a bit.
-->

<!-- Paragraphs -->

<!-- What would you expect the following text to output on an HTML page? 
    <body>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Doloribus, porro distinctio! 
        
        Officiis corporis quidem in blanditiis ab consequatur est accusamus? 
        
        Asperiores qui ducimus pariatur minus sunt eius reiciendis similique inventore!
    </body>

    It looks like two paragraphs of text, so you might expect it to display in that way.
    !! However, that is not the case, as you can see in the output below.

    output: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Doloribus, porro distinctio! Officiis corporis quidem in blanditiis ab consequatur est accusamus? Asperiores qui ducimus pariatur minus sunt eius reiciendis similique inventore!
    (^ yep, that long stuff)

    When the browser encounters new lines like this in your HTML, it will compress them down into one single space.
    The result of this compression is that all of the text is clumped together into one long line.

    If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the paragraph element, which will
    add a new line after each of our paragraphs. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping
    text content with a <p> tag.

    Changing our example from before to use paragraph elements fixes the issue: (next section)
-->

<!-- 
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Doloribus, porro distinctio!</p>
        
    <p>Officiis corporis quidem in blanditiis ab consequatur est accusamus?</p>
        
    <p>Asperiores qui ducimus pariatur minus sunt eius reiciendis similique inventore!</p>
-->

<!-- or... in proper HTML syntax
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p> Lorem ipsum...</p>

            <p> Iorem lpsum...</p>
        </body>
    </html>
-->

<!-- Headings -->

<!-- Headings are different from other HTML text elements:
     they are displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they are headings.
     
     There are 6 different levels of headings starting from <h1> to <h6>.
     The number within the heading tag represents that heading's level.
     The largest and most important heading is h1, while h6 is the tiniest heading
     at the lowest level.
     
     Headings are defined much like paragraphs. For example, to create an h1 heading,
     we wrap our heading text in an <h1> tag.
-->

<!-- or... in proper HTML syntax
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
            <h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
            <h3>This is a heading 3</h3>
            <h4>This is a heading 4</h4>
            <h5>This is a heading 5</h5>
            <h6>This is a heading 6</h6>
        </body>
    </html>
-->

<!-- Using the correct level of heading is important as levels provide a hierarchy to the content.
     An h1 heading should always be used for the heading of the overall page, 
     and the lower level headings should be used as the headings for content
     in smaller sections of the page.
-->


<!-- Strong Element -->

<!-- The <strong> element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as important;
     this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with visual impairments will rely on to
     use your website.
     
     The tone of voice on some screen readers will change to communicate the importance of text
     within a strong element. To define a strong element, we wrap text content in a <strong> tag.
        
     You can use strong on its own:
-->

<!-- or... in proper HTML syntax
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <strong>Lorem ipsum dolor</strong>
        </body>
    </html>

    !! But you will probably find yourself using the strong element much more in combination with other text elements, like this:
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>Lorem ipsum <strong>dolor sit</strong> amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
-->

<!-- Em (italic/emphasized) element -->

<!-- The <em> element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on the tet,
     which again may affect things like screen readers. To define an emphasized element, wrap
     the text content in an <em> tag.

     To use <em> on its own: (next section)
-->

<!-- or... in proper HTML syntax 
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
        <em>Some emphasized text</em>
        </body>
    </html>

    !! Again, like the strong element, you will find yourself mostly using the <em> element with other text elements:
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>Lorem ipsum <em>dolor sit</em> amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
-->

<!-- Nesting and Indentation -->

<!-- You may have noticed that in all the examples in this lesson, we indent any elements that are within other elements.
     This is known as nesting elements.
     
     When we nest elements within other elements, we create a parent and child relationship between them.
     The nested elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.
     
     In the following example, the body element is the parent and the paragraph is the child.
-->

<!-- or... in proper HTML syntax 
    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body> <- parent
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p> <- child
        </body>
    </html>

    !! Just as in human relationships, HTML parent elements can have many children.
    Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be siblings.

    For example, the two paragraphs in the following code are sibling, since they are both children
    of the body tag and are at the same level of nesting as each other:

    <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
            <p>Ut enim ad minim veniam.</p>
        </body>
    </html>
-->

<!-- We use indentation to make the level of nesting clear and readable for ourselves and
     other developers who will work with our HTML in the future. In our examples, we have
     indented any child elements by two spaces per nesting level.
     
     The parent, child, and sibling relationships between elements will 
     become much more important later when we start styling our HTML with CSS
     and adding behavior with JavaScript.
     
     For now, however, it is just important to know the distinction between how
     elements are related and the terminology used to describe their relationships.
-->

<!-- HTML comments (hello!)
     HTML comments are not visible to the browser; they allow us to comment on our code
     so that other developers or our future selves can read them and get some context about something that might not be clear in the code.
-->

<!-- In order to write an HTML comment, we just enclose the comment with -->
     <!-- Hello! -->

<!-- or... in proper HTML syntax -->
    <!-- <h1> View the HTML to see the hidden comments </h1> -->

    <!-- I am an HTML comment -->

    <!-- <p>Some paragraph text</p> -->

    <!-- I am another HTML comment -->
