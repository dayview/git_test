<!-- Links and Images -->

<!-- Links are one of the key features of HTML. They allows us to link to other HTML pages on the web. In fact, this is why it's called the web!
-->

<!-- In preparation, the module instructed us to with the given steps:
     1. Create a new directory named "odin-links-and-images"
     2. Within that directory, create a new file named "index.html"
     3. Open the file in any IDE you want and fill in the usual HTML boilerplate
     4. Finally, add the following <h1> to the body:
        <h1>Homepage</h1>
-->

<!-- in sample HTML syntax:
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Homepage</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
-->

<!-- To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor element is  
     defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be in a link with an <a> tag.

     Add the following to the body of the "index.html" page we created and open it in the browser:
-->

<!-- in sample HTML syntax:
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Homepage</h1>
            <a>About The Odin Project</a>
        </body>
     </html>
-->

<!-- You may have noticed that clicking
     this link doesn't do anything. This is because an anchor tag on its own won't know where we want to link to.
     
     We have to tell it a destination to go to.
     
     We do this by using an HTML attribute.
-->

<!-- An HTML attribute gives additional
     information to an HTML element and always go in the element's opening tag.
     
     An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a name, and a value; however, not all attributes require a value.
     
     In our case, we need to add an <href> (hypertext reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. The value of the <href> attribute is the destination we want our link to go to.
        
     Add the following <href> attribute to the anchor element we created previously and try clicking it again, don't forget to refresh the browser so the new changes can be applied.
-->

<!--
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF=8">
            <title>Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Homepage</h1>
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>
        </body>
     </html>
-->

<!-- By default, any text wrapped with an anchor   
     tag without an <href> attribute will look like plain text.

     If the <href> attribute is present, the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link.

     It's worth noting you can use anchor tags to link any kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. You can link to videos, PDFs, images, and so on, but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents.
-->

<!-- Opening Links in a New Tab -->

<!-- The method shown above opens links in the
     same tab as the webpage containing them.
     
     This is the default behavior of most browsers and it can be changed relatively easily. All we need is another attribute: the <target> attribute.
        
     While <href> specifies the destination link, <target> specifies where the linked resource will be opened. If it's not present, then, by default, it will take on the <_self> value which opens the link in the current tab.
        
     To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to <_blank> as follows:
-->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Homepage</h1>
            <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a>
        </body>
    </html>

    !! You may have noticed that the module snucked in the <rel> attribute above. This attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.

    <noopener>: The <noopener> value of the rel attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window cannot interact with or access the original page. Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which poses a security risk.

    For example, 
    <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Example</a>

    !! In this code: <target="_blank">: Opens the link in a new tab.

    rel="noopener": Prevents the new tab from accessing the original page, ensuring security. Without <noopener>, the new tab could use JavaScript to interact with the original page, which is unsafe.

    <noreferrer>: The <noreferrer> value of the <rel> attribute provides both privacy and security. It prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer) and also includes the behavior of <noopener>, preventing the new page from accessing the original page.

    For example,
    <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Visit Example</a>

    !! In this example, <target="_blank">: Opens the link in a new tab. <rel="noreffer": Ensures the new page cannot see the referring page's address (privacy) and prevents it from accessing the original page (security).

    By using rel="noreferrer", you automatically get the benefits of both privacy and security.

    !! Why do we need this added behavior for opening links in new tabs? Security reasons. The prevention of access that is caused by <noopener> prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to as "tabnabbing".

    !! Adding the <noreferrer> value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it.

    !! Note that you may be fine if you forget to add <rel="noopener noreferrer"> since more recent versions of browsers provide security if only <target="_blank"> is present.

    !! Nevertheless, in line with good coding practices and to err on the side of caution, it is recommended to always pair a <target="_blank"> with a <rel="noreferrer"> (which also includes <noopener>).

<!-- Absolute and Relative Links -->

<!-- Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create:
     1. Links to pages on other websites on the internet
     
     2. Links to pages located on our own websites
-->

<!-- Absolute Links -->

<!-- Links to pages on other websites on the
     internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link would be made up of the following parts: scheme://domain/path.
     
     An absolute link will always contain the scheme and domain of the destination.
     
     The link we created to The Odin Project's About Page earlier was an absolute link as it contains the scheme and domain.
     
     https:// (scheme)
     www.theodinproject.com (domain)
     /about (path)
-->

<!-- Relative Links -->

<!-- Links to other pages within our own website
     are called relative links. Relative links do
     not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.

     Relative links only include the file path to the other page, relative to the page you are creating the link on.

     Within the odin-links-and-images directory, create another HTML file named "about.html" and paste the following code into it:

     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>Odin Links and Images</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>About Page</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
-->

<!-- Back in the index page, add the
     following element to create a link to the about page:
     <body>
        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>
        
        <a href="about.html">About</a>
     </body>
-->

<!-- Open the index file in a browser and
     click on the about link to make sure it is all wired together correctly.

     Clicking the link should go to the about page we just created.

     This works because the index and about page are in the same directory. That means we can use its name "about.html" as the link's <href> value.

     But we will usually want to organize our website directories a little better. Normally, we would only have the "index.html" at the root directory and all other HTML files in their own directory.
-->

<!-- Create a directory named "pages"
     within the "odin-links-and-images" directory and move the "about.html" file into this new directory.
     
     Refresh the index page in the browser and then click on the about link. It will now be broken. This is because the location of the about page file has changed.

     To fix this, we just need to update the about link <href> value to include the "pages/" directory since that is the new location of the about file relative to the index file.
     <body>
        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>
     </body>
-->

<!-- Refresh the index page in the browser
     and try clicking the about link again, it should now be back in working order.
     
     In many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run into unexpected issues with this approach.Prepending "./" before the link will in most cases prevent such issues.
     
     By adding "./", you are specifying your code that it should stat looking for the file/directory relative to the current directory.
     <body>
        <h1>Homepage</h1>
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
     </body>
-->

<!-- A metaphor:
     Think of your domain name (town.com) as a "town", the directory in which your website is located (/museum) as a "museum", and each page on your website as a room in the museum (/museum/movie_room.html and /museum/shops/coffee_shop.html).

     Relative links like ./shops/coffee_shop.html are directions from the current room (the museum movie room -> /museum/movie_room.html) to another room (the museum shop).

     Absolute links, on the other hand, are full directions including the protocol (https), domain name (town.com), and the path from that domain name (/museum/shops/coffee_shop.html):https://town.com/museum/shops/coffee_shops.html
-->

<!-- Images -->

<!-- Websites would be fairly boring if 
     they could only display text. Luckily, HTML provides a wide variety of elements for displaying all sorts of different media. The most widely used of these is the image element.
     
     To display an image in HTML we use the <img> element. Unlike the other elements we have encountered, the <img> element is a void element. As we have seen earlier in the course, void elements do NOT need a closing tag because they are naturally empty and do not contain any content.

     Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using a <src> attribute, which tells the browser where the image file is located.

     The <src> attribute works much like the <href> attribute for anchor tags. It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.

     For example, using an absolute path we can display an image located on The Odin Project site:
     <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
