<!-- Links -->

<!-- Links are created with the <a>
     element, which stands for "anchor". It works just like all the elements in the previous chapter: when you wrap some text in <a> tags, it alters the meaning of that content.
-->

<!-- If we add the following paragraph to
     the <body> element of "links.html":
        <p>This example is about links and <a>images</a>.</p>

     !! If you load the page in a web browser, you'll notice that the <a> element doesn't look like a link at all. Yes, unfortunately, the <a> element on its own doesn't do much of anything.
-->

<!-- In the same way that an element
     adds meaning to the content it contains, an HTML attribute adds meaning to the element it's attached to.
     
     "Attribute" (href) -> "Element (<a>)-> "Content" ("Hello!")

     The <href> attribute determines where the user goes when they click an <a> element. Update your link to match the following:
        <p>This example is about links and<a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>

     !! Notice how attributes live inside the opening tag. The attribute name comes first, then an equal sign, then the "value" of the attribute in either single or double quotation marks. This syntax distinguishes attributes from content (which goes between the tags!).

     The extra bit of information provided by the <href> attribute tells the browser that this <a> element is in fact, a LINK, and it should render the content in its default blue text!
-->

<!-- Absolute, Relative, and Root-Relative Links -->

<!-- We need to understand how a website
     is structured. For our purposes, a website is just a collection of HTML files organized into folders.
    
     To refer to those files from inside of another file, the Internet uses "uniform resource locators" (URLs). Depending on what you're referring to, URLs can take different forms.
     
     The three types of URLs we'll be dealing with are highlighted below:
     
     Imagine you are on a page called "page.html" inside "our-site.com". From that page, you can create three kinds of links to other pages:

     1. Relative Link
     A relative URL is like saying "go to the file next to me."

     From "page.html", a link to "other-page.html" in the same folder can just be:
     <a href="other-page.html">Other page</a>

     Alternatively, you could use <a href="../other-page.html">Other page</a>
     
     The browser starts from the current page's folder and looks for "other-page.html" there.

     2. Root-relative Link
     A root-relative URl is like saying "start from the home folder of our-site.com, then walk to this file."

     It begins with a "/": <a href="/other-page.html">Other page</a>

     No matter where "page.html" is nested, the browser jumps to the site root (our-site.com/) and then looks for "other-page.html" from there.

     3. Absolute Link
     An absolute URL is like giving the browser a full postal address, including the domain:
     <a href="https://elsewhere.org/external-page.html">External page</a>

     Here the browser leaves "our-site.com" entirely and goes to another domain, "elsewhere.org", then to 
     "/external-page.html".

     !! Absolute, relative, and root-relative links refer to the value of the <href> attribute. The next few sections will explain how and when to use each of them.
-->

<!-- Absolute Links -->

<!-- "Absolute" links are the most
      detailed way you can refer to a web resource. They start with "scheme"/"protocol" (typically http:// or https://), followed by the domain name of the website, then the path of the target web page.

      "Scheme" - https://
      "Domain" - developer.mozilla.org
      "Path" - /en-us/docs/web/html

      <li>Absolute links, like to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>

      !! It's possible to use absolute links to refer to pages in your own website, but hard-coding your domain name everywhere can make for some tricky situations. It's usually a better idea to reserve absolute links only for directing users to a different website.
-->

<!-- Relative Links -->

<!-- "Relative" links point to another
     file in your website from the vantage point of the file you're editing.
     
     It's implied that the scheme and domain name are the same as the current page, so the only thing you need to supply is the path.

     <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.</li>

     !! In this case, the href attribute represents the file path to "extras.html" from the "links.html" file. Since "extras.html" isn't in the same folder as "links.html", we need to include the "misc" folder in the URL.

     Each folder and file in a path is separated by a forward slash (/). So, if we were trying to get to a file that was TWO folders deep, we'd need a URL like this:
     misc/other-folder/extras.html
-->

<!-- Parent Folders -->

<!-- That works for referring to files
     that are in the same folder or a deeper folder.
     
     What about linking to pages that are in a directory above the current file?
     
     <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may also be interested in <a href="links.html">links</a> or <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>

     When you click either of those links in a web browser, it will complain that the page doesn't exist.

     Examining the address bar, you'll discover that the browser is trying to load "misc/links.html" and "misc/images.html" it's looking in the wrong folder!

     That's because our links are relative to the location of "extras.html", which lives in the "misc" folder.

     When "extras.html" is looking for "links.html" and "images.html" via relative links (which has no parent reference), it will cause an error/fail since the page does not exist.

     !! To fix this, we need the ".." syntax. Two consecutive dots in a file path represent a pointer to the parent directory.

     <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may also be interested in <a href="../links.html">links</a> or <a href="../images.html">images</a>.</p>

     !! This is like saying, "I know "extras.html" is in the "misc" folder. Go up a folder and look for "links.html" and "images.html" in there.

     Now, when "extras.html" is looking for "links.html" and "images.html" via relative links (which has a parent reference now), it will proceed as usual/normal.

     !! To navigate up through multiple directories, use multiple ".." references, like so:

     ../../elsewhere.html

     Relative links are nice because they let you move around entire folders without having to update all the <href>'s on your <a> elements, but they can get a little confusing when all your links start with a bunch of dots.

     They're best for referring to resources in the same folder or in a standalone section of your website.

     For example, all the images in HTML & CSS Is Hard (the current module based on) are loaded with relative URLs.

     This allows us to rename any of our chapter slugs without having to update all our image paths.
-->
    
<!-- Root-relative Links -->

<!-- "Root-relative" links are similar to
     the previous section, but instead of being relative to the current page, they're relative to the "root" of the entire website.
     
     For instance, if your website is hosted on "our-site.com", all root-relative URLs will be relative to "our-site.com".

     !! Unfortunately, there is one caveat to our discussion of root-relative links: this entire tutorial uses local HTML files instead of a website hosted on a web server.

     This means we won't be able to experiment with root-relative links. But, if we did have a real server, the link to our home page would look like this:
     (This won't work for our local HTML files)
     <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href="/">home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.<li>
-->

<!-- The only difference between a root-
     relative link and a relative one is that the former starts with a forward slash. That initial forward slash represents the root of your site.
     
     You can add more folders and files to the path after that initial slash, just like relative links.
     
     The following path will work correctly no matter where the current page is located (even in "misc/extras.html"):
     
     /images.html

     Root-relative links are some of the most useful kinds of links. They're explicit enough to avoid the potential confusion of relative links, but they're not overly explicit like absolute links. You'll see a lot of them throughout your web development career, especially in larger websites where it's hard to keep track of relative references.
-->

<!-- Link Targets -->

<!-- Attributes alter the meaning of HTML
     elements, and sometimes you need to modify more than one aspect of an element.
     
     For example, <a> elements also accept a <target> attribute that defines where to display the page when the user clicks the link.
        
     By default, most browsers replace the current page with the new one. We can use the <target> attribute to ask the browser to open a link in a new window/tab.
    
     <li>Absolute links, like to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>

     The <target> attribute has a few pre-defined values that carry special meaning for web browsers, but the most common one is <_blank>, which specifies a new tab or window.
-->

<!-- Naming Conventions -->

<!-- Spaces in URLs require special
     handling and should be avoided at all costs. To see what we're talking about, try creating a new file in our "links-and-images" project called "spaces are bad.html". Add a little bit of text to it, then open it in Google Chrome or Safari.
    
     links-and-images/spaces%20are%20bad.html

     In the address bar, you'll see that all our spaces have been replaced with "%20", as shown above. Spaces aren't allowed in URLs, and that's the special encoding used to represent them.

     Instead of a space, you should always use a hyphen, as we've been doing throughout this tutorial. It's also a good idea to use all lowercase characters for consistency.

     Notice how there's a direct connection between our file/folder names and the URL for the web page they represent. The names of our folders and files determine the "slugs" for our web pages.

     They're visible to the user, which means you should put in as much effort into naming your files as you put into creating the content they contain.

     These naming conventions apply to all of the files in your site, not just HTML files. CSS files, JavaScript files, and images should avoid spaces and have consistent capitalization, too.
-->

<!-- Images -->

<!-- Unlike all the HTML elements
     we've encountered so far, image content is defined outside of the web page that renders it.
     
     Fortunately for us, we already have a way to refer to external resources from within an HTML document: absolute, relative, and root-relative URLs.
     
     Images are included in web pages with the <img/> tag and its <src> attribute, which points to the image file you want to display.
        
     Notice how it's an empty element like <br/> and <hr/>.
     
     <img src="some-photo.jpg"/>

     Retina displays and mobile devices make image handling a little bit more complicated than a plain old <img/> tag.

     !! Module note: We'll leave these complexities for the Responsive Images chapter of the tutorial. Also be sure to check out the <figure> and <figcaption> element in the Semantic HTML chapter.

     For now, let's focus on the many image formats floating around the Internet.
-->

<!-- Image Formats -->

<!-- There's four main image formats in
     use on the web, and they were all designed to do different things.
     
     Understanding their intended purpose goes a long way towards improving the quality of your web pages.
-->

<!-- JPG Images -->

<!-- JPG images are designed for
     handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size.
     
     This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them.
     
     On the other hand, JPGs don't allow for transparent pixels, which you can see in the white edges of the images below if you look real close.
-->

<!-- GIF Images -->

<!-- GIFs are the go-to option for simple
     animations, but the trade off is that they're somewhat limited in terms of color palette, never use them for photos.
     
     Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can't have semi-opaque pixels.
     
     This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background.
     
     For this reason, it's usually better to use PNG images if you don't need animation.
-->

<!-- PNG Images -->

<!-- PNGs are great for anything that's not a photo
     or animated.
     
     For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file.
     
     However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don't have color palette limitations.
     
     This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.
-->

<!-- SVG Images -->

<!-- Unlike the pixel-based formats above, SVG is
     a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality.
     
     This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design.
     
     They're good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can.

     These 300x300 pixel images (mochi.svg) were originally 100x100 pixels, but scaling them up clearly shows the difference between them.

     Notice the crisp lines on the left SVG image, while the PNG image on the right is now very pixelated.

     Despite being a vector format, SVGs can be used exactly like their raster counterparts.
     
     There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor (e.g., Adobe Illustrator or Sketch). If your images contain a lot of text (like the fancy screenshots in this tutorial), this can have a big impact on file size.

     For this reason, the module site uses PNGs instead of SVGs, even though SVGs are so awesome.
-->

<!-- Image Dimensions -->

<!-- By default, the <img/> element uses the inherit
     dimensions of its image file. Our JPG, GIF, and PNG images are actually 150x150 pixels, while our SVG mochi is only 75x75 pixels.

     As the module discusses further in Responsive Images, pixel-based image formats need to be twice as big as you want them to appear on retina displays.

     To get our pixel-based images down to the intended size (75x75), we can use the <img/> element's <width> attribute.

        <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75">
        <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75">
        <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75">

     The <width> attribute sets an explicit dimension for the image. There's a corresponding <height> attribute, as well.

     !! Setting only one of them will cause the image to scale proportionally, while defining both will stretch the image.

     !! Dimension values are specified in pixels, and you should never include a unit (e.g., width="75px" would be incorrect!)

     !! The <width> and <height> attributes can be useful, but it's usually better to set image dimensions with CSS so you can alter them with media queries. The module notes to discuss this more in detail about responsive design.
-->

<!-- Text Alternatives -->

<!-- Adding <alt> attributes to your <img/> elements
     is a best practice. It defines a "text alternative" to the image being displayed.
     
     This has an impact on both search engines and users with text-only browsers (e.g., people that use text-to-speech software due to vision impairment).

     Update all images to include descriptive <alt> attributes:
        <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble"/>
        <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="A dancing mochi ball"/>
        <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="A mochi ball"/>
        <img src="images/mochi.svg" alt="A mochi ball with Bezier handles"/>
-->

<!-- More HTML Attributes -->

<!-- Every web page you create should define the
     language it's written and its character set.
-->

<!-- Document Language -->

<!-- A web page's default language is defined by the
     <lang> attribute on the top-level <html> element.
        
     Our document is in English, so we'll use the <en> country code as the attribute value (do this for all of the pages we created):
        
     <html lang="en">

     If you're not sure what the country code for your language is, you can look it up on iana.org under the Subtag field.
-->

<!-- Character Sets -->

<!-- A "character set" is kind of like a digital
     alphabet for your browser. It's different from the language of your document in that it only affects how the letters themselves are rendered, not the language of the content.
     
     Let's copy and paste some international characters into our "misc/extras.html" web page and see what happens!
    
     <h2>Character Sets</h2>
     <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>bir</li>
            <li>iki</li>
            <li>üç</li>
            <li>dört</li>
            <li>beş</li>
        </ol>

     When you view this in a browser, you'll see some werid stuff where the ü, ç, ö, and ş characters should be.

     !! That's because the default character set for most browser doesn't accommodate these "special" characters.

     !! To fix this, specify a UTF-8 character encoding by adding a <meta> element with a <charset> attribute to the <head> of our "misc/extras.html" file:
        <meta charset="UTF-8"/>

     The special characters should now render correctly. These days, UTF-8 is sort of like a universal alphabet for the Internet. Every web page you create should have this line in its <head>.
-->

<!-- HTML Entities -->

<!-- An "HTML entity" is a special character that
     can't be represented as plain text in an HTMl document.
     
     This typically either means it's a reserved character in HTMl or you don't have a key on your keyboard for it.
-->

<!-- Reserved Characters -->

<!-- The <, >, and & characters are called
     "reserved characters" because they aren't allowed to be inserted into an HTML document without being encoded.
     
     This is because they mean something in the HTML syntax: < - begins a new tag, > - ends a tag, and as we're about to learn, & sets of an HTML entity.

     In "misc/extras.html", add the following:
     <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
        <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>

     !! Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). In between, you put a special code that your browser will interpret as a symbol.

     In this case, it interprets "lt", "gt", and "amp" as less-than, greater-than, and ampersand symbols, respectively.

     There's a crap-ton of HTML entities, you can explore more on dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref.
-->

<!-- Quotes -->

<!-- Curly quotes are by no means necessary, but
     if you care about typography they'll be some of the most common HTML entities you'll use.
     
     There's four different kinds of curly quotes (opening and closing single and double quotes):
     * &ldquo;
     * &rdquo;
     * &lsquo;
     * &rsquo;

     You can use them in place of ' and " straight quotes, like so:
     <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>

     !! Unlike straight quotes, these curly quotes entities should hug the text.
-->
