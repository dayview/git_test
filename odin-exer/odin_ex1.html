<!-- Given Task:
    Create a simple HTML snippet about your favorite hobby
    Write a code that includes:
    1. One heading
    2. Two paragraphs with at least one sentence each
    3. Use <strong> to emphasize one word
    4. Use <em> to emphasize one different word
-->

<h1> My favorite hobbies are:</h1>
<p> Playing <em>video games</em>, as I'm currently playing DOTA 2 and Slime Rancher during the break.</p>
<p> Practicing <strong>code</strong> over the break, to prepare for my next class, which is web applications development!</p>

<!-- Module Test 
    1. What's the difference between an HTML tag and an HTML element?
        An HTML tag is the unique identifier for initializing the content to be typed,
        while an HTML element is the whole combination of the declaration tags and the content inside of the declaration tag.

    2. Write the complete HTML element for a paragraph that says "Learning HTML is fun!"
        <p> "Learning HTML is fun!" </p>

    3. Which of these is a void element that doesn't need a closing tag?
        <img>
        <p>, <div>, and <strong> requires a closing tag

    4. What's wrong with this code?
        <div>
            <p> Hello World </div>
            </p>

        Correct Code:
        <div>
            <p> Hello World </p>
        </div>

        The code is not properly initialized and not indented properly. 
        
        (starts with <p> and ends with </div> and </p>
        is not on the same indentation level as div, 
        assuming </p> is </div>)


        !! The <p> opens inside <div>, so it must close before </div> closes. 
            Think of it like nested parentheses in Java,
            they must close in reverse order of opening.

        !!! Indentation doesn't affect functionality (browsers ignore whitespace, but proper tag order is mandatory.)
    
    5. Write an HTML snippet with:
            <h2> "My Skills" </h2>
            <p> "I know <strong> Java </strong> and databases" </p>
-->

<!-- Knowledge Check 
    1. What is an HTML tag?
    An HTML tag is a predefined tag that initializes the structure and content of a webpage

    2. What are the three parts of an HTML element?
    It consists of (1) the opening tag (<p>), (2) the content defined in the wrapped tag, (3) the closing tag (</p>)

    3. What are void elements, and how are they different from regular HTML elements?
    Void elements are elements that doesn't need a closing tag since they have no possible content to wrap inside.
    They are different from regular HTML elements by needing a closing tag, where as void elements don't have to.
