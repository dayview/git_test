        <h1> My Journey Learning Web Development </h1>
        <h2> Why I Started</h2>
        <p> I started because I wanted to learn how to do <strong>full-stack programming</strong>, and prepare myself for my next class, which is <strong>CCAPDEV</strong>.</p>
        <p> <strong>CCAPDEV</strong> is one of my last major requirements in my college stay so when I'm done here, I can finally prepare for my thesis.</p>
        <h2> What I'm Learning</h2>
        <p> When I think about <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em> and <em>JS</em>, these three are the bread, butter, and jam! (haha) of the introductory module for web development.</p>
        <p> It might seem intimidating for me since I'm learning three discrete syntaxes for developing, but I can take a challenge.</p>
        <h2> My Goals</h2>
        <p> By April, I want to realize that I am capable of developing a website without depending too much on AI, and relearn my coding strategy.</p>
        <p> It's a hard start, but I can't wait what happens by that time.</p>
